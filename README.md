# board_canaries
Code to run on every board, to run canary tests

## To set up a new board:
- Create a new robot, likely in the `viam-hardware-testing` org, in the "Board Canaries" location.
- Install Viam on the new board, per the Setup tab in the robot you just created.
- Clone this repo onto the board.
- More to come soon!
