# Most board canaries should not use this file, but one of them (likely the pi5) needs to have a
# cron job to monitor all the others. This file is a sketch of a file that should be dropped into
# /etc/cron.d on that one board. You should modify CANARY_DIR to its actual value before copying
# it over.

# If we ever need a virtual environment to run Python, remember to use bash as the shell, and not
# just sh! The sh shell doesn't know what `source` is, so sourcing the venv fails.
SHELL=/bin/bash

# The canary tests run at 2:30 AM, the analysis runs at 2:45. If boards are still online at 3:00,
# they probably ran the tests, so we should check on them then.
